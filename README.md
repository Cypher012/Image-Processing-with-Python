# Image-Processing-with-Python

## Project Overview

This repository contains various examples and techniques for performing image processing tasks using Python. As I learn about image processing and its applications, this collection of scripts and modules will expand. The focus is on utilizing popular libraries such as OpenCV and SciPy to explore techniques like thresholding, denoising, edge detection, histogram-based segmentation, and more.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, youâ€™ll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries.

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Processing-with-Python.git
cd Image-Processing-with-Python
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
